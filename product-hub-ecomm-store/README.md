## State Management

The application uses **React Context API** for global state management through the `ShopContext`:

```javascript
// Available context values
{
  // Authentication
  currentUser,         // Currently logged-in user object with role (null if not logged in)
  login,               // Function to login user (saves user & token)
  logout,              // Function to logout user
  
  // Shopping Cart (user-specific)
  cartItems,           // Array of items in cart for current user
  addToCart,           // Add product to cart
  increaseQty,         // Increase product quantity
  decreaseQty,         // Decrease product quantity
  removeFromCart,      // Remove item from cart
  cartCount,           // Total quantity of items in cart
  isInCart,            // Check if product is in cart
  getQtyInCart,        // Get quantity of specific product in cart
  
  // Saved Items (user-specific, wishlist)
  savedItems,          // Array of saved/favorited items for current user
  toggleSave,          // Save/unsave a product
  isSaved              // Check if product is saved
}
```

### User-Specific Storage

Each user's cart and saved items are stored separately in localStorage with user ID-based keys:
- `cart_userId` - User's shopping cart
- `savedItems_userId` - User's saved items

This ensures **complete data isolation** - when a user logs in, they see only their items; when they log out, their items remain saved and are automatically loaded when they log back in.

Data is persisted to localStorage automatically whenever cart or saved items change.

## Features Usage

### Authentication
- **Sign Up**: Create a new account with your full name, email, and password
- **Login**: Sign in with your email and password to access your personalized account
- **Secure**: Passwords are hashed using bcryptjs; login (email/password or Google) issues JWT tokens
- **User Session**: Stay logged in across browser sessions; logout removes your session
- **User-Specific Data**: Each user's cart and saved items are completely isolated

### Shopping Cart
- Click the floating shopping cart button (bottom-left) to open the cart drawer
- View all items in your cart with quantities and prices (user-specific)
- Use +/- buttons to adjust item quantities
- Click the X button to remove items from cart
- The cart badge shows total number of items
- Cart total is calculated automatically
- Cart persists across sessions for logged-in users

### Saved Items
- Click the heart icon on any product card to save it
- Saved items appear in the navbar (shows count)
- View all saved items on the dedicated Saved page
- Saved items persist across sessions for logged-in users
- Your saved items are only visible to you

### Admin Dashboard
- **Admin Access**: Only users with admin role can access the admin dashboard
- **Protected Routes**: Admin dashboard is protected with role-based access control
- **Login History**: View all user login records with timestamps and email addresses
- **Signup Management**: Track all user registrations with creation dates and account information
- **User Management**: View and manage registered users and their information
- **Admin Navigation**: Dedicated admin interface separate from the main user interface
- **Secure Access**: JWT tokens verify admin authorization before granting access

- **Get All Products**: Fetches up to 30 products with customizable limits
- **Get Single Product**: Retrieves detailed information for a specific product
- **Search Products**: Searches products by query string
- **Get Categories**: Fetches all available product categories

## Installation

### Environment Setup

#### Backend `.env` file (in `backend/` folder):

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id

# Email Configuration (for OTP password reset)
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail_address@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

#### Frontend `.env` file (in `frontend/` folder):

```env
# Google OAuth
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
```

**Note**: 
- For Google OAuth, create credentials at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
- For email, use Gmail with an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (not your regular password)
- The `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` should be the same in both backend and frontend `.env` files

### Backend Setup (Authentication Server)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   Or for development (auto-restart):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` with the following endpoints:
   - `POST http://localhost:3000/api/signup` - Register a new user
   - `POST http://localhost:3000/api/login` - Login user
   - `POST http://localhost:3000/api/google-login` - Login/register with Google
   - `GET/POST http://localhost:3000/api/orders` - Manage orders
   - `PATCH/DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/orders/:orderId` - Update/delete an order

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

For local development, run the backend and frontend in separate terminals.

1. Start backend (Terminal 1):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev or node server.js
   ```

2. Start frontend with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) (Terminal 2):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
